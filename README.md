## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned the following:

- How to work with Google Fonts to enhance typography.
- Revisiting and refining my understanding of media queries for responsive design.
- Utilizing Flexbox for creating flexible and responsive layouts.

```css
body {
    background-color: var(--Light-gray);
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 15px;
    font-size: 15px;
}
```

Using Flexbox properties like justify-content and align-items makes it easy to center elements without relying on position properties.

### Continued development

As I continue to learn more about front-end development, I plan to improve this project by:

- Adding more advanced CSS techniques.
- Experimenting with CSS Grid for layout.
- Enhancing accessibility features.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Great resource for revisiting basic concepts and getting quick references.
- [ChatGPT](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://chat.openai.com/&ved=2ahUKEwi4pJXa25qGAxVwWEEAHUJBACEQFnoECAYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw139HWUX4D802zbDuJCdFg9) - Helpful for generating code snippets and getting explanations.
